# Chat app made with svelte and socket.io

To start the website + server run `npm start`

Make sure you create a .env file in the root of the project and add `URL=your_mongodb_uri` also add `KEY=secret` the secret can be anything, this will be used for encrypting data.


Server will probably have to be hosted separately if you are building for prod
